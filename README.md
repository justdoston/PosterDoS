How to use
 
This tool capable of sending large amount of attack in 1 attempt. In this example number of request  10 thousand, number of attempts 100 it means tool send 100 parallel request in one time. 

How attack works
 
Each request contain 5 KB of small data. But you can control it. For example if you want to sent 1 MB of data in 1 attempt you can set 205 request to per attempt 5KB x 205 = 1025 KB ~ 1MB.

WARNING !
 
DO NOT SENT tremendous amount of request in to 1 attempt. Because it may cause crash of your pc or slow down your internet speed.

ATTENTION
 
Speed of your internet plays a big role, if tool doesn't work in expected speed your internet speed can be possible reason. If you want to send 2005 request in 1 attempt (10 MB data) your internet speed should be higher than 80 Mbps. Because 80 Mbps/8 equal to 10 MB per second.

Only 1 pc may not enough to test actual power of website. Attacking 1 person is DOS, attacking a lot of peopl is DDOS
